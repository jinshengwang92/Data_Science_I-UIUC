    "## Python Data Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides built-in support for a number of useful data structures,\n",
    "including the _string_, _tuple_, _list_, and _dictionary_:\n",
    "\n",
    "__String__: \n",
    "A sequence of zero or more characters that are enclosed within either a\n",
    "pair of single quote characters, `'`, or a pair of double quote\n",
    "characters, `\"`. A Python string is an instance of class `str`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`A string containing many characters`\n",
    "\n",
    "__Tuple__:\n",
    "An ordered sequence of zero or more values that are enclosed in\n",
    "parentheses, `(` and `)`. The different values in a tuple are generally separated\n",
    "by commas, although this is not required. A Python tuple is an instance of class `tuple`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)`\n",
    "\n",
    "__List__:\n",
    "An ordered sequence of zero or more values that are enclosed in square\n",
    "brakets, `[` and `]`. The different valus in the list are separated by\n",
    "commas. A Python list is an instance of class `list`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`\n",
    "\n",
    "__Dictionary__:\n",
    "An unordered collection of key, value pairs that are enclosed in curly\n",
    "braces, `{` and `}`. A key is separated form its corresponding value by\n",
    "a colon `:` and the different key-value entries in the collection are\n",
    "separated by commas. A Python dictionary is an instance of class `dict`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`d = {'name': \"Alexander\", 'age': 30, 'location': (102.1, 32.1)}`\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "Of these four data structures, the _list_ and the _dictionary_ are\n",
    "mutable, which means the values stored in these structures can be\n",
    "changed. On the other hand,  the _string_ and the _tuple_ are immutable,\n",
    "which means the values can not be changed once created. Instead, a new\n",
    "data structure must be created, either explicitly by the programmer, or\n",
    "implicitly by the Python interpreter. All of these data structures can be\n",
    "displayed by using the Python built-in `print` function, which converts\n",
    "its arguments to a string, which is then sent to STDOUT:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",
    "print(data)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The _dictionary_ is a special data structure that maps keys to values,\n",
    "and thus the keys, which can be stored in any order, are used to access\n",
    "the values. The other three structures are ordered sequences, and thus\n",
    "individual elements can be accessed by specifying an index position\n",
    "within square brackets, `[]`, with the caveat that Python is a\n",
    "zero-indexed language. Thus, given an ordered sequence `data`, the\n",
    "following accesses are legal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `a[0]`: access the first value\n",
    "- `a[1]`: access the second value\n",
    "- `a[-1]`: access the last value\n",
    "- `a[-2]`: access the second to last value\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports a rich array of techniques for extracting values from an\n",
    "ordered list beyond the single value access method, known as slicing.\n",
    "Given an ordered sequence `data`, the basic format is\n",
    "`data[start:end:stride]` where start and end are the starting and\n",
    "ending index values, respectively, and stride is the number of values to\n",
    "skip when iterating. If start or end are omitted, the default is the\n",
    "first and last value, while the default stride is one. A negative value\n",
    "can be used for either the start or the end index values, which\n",
    "indicates relative to the end value. These concepts are demonstrated in\n",
    "the following code block:"
