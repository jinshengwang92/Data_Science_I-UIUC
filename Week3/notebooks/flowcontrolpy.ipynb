    "far is the `for` loop, which is used to iterate through a sequence like\n",
    "a list, tuple, or dictionary. The indented code block that follows colon\n",
    "character at the end of the `for` statement is executed for each loop.\n",
    "The following loops demonstrate the use of the `for` loop to iterate\n",
    "through the items in different Python data structures:\n",
