    "\n",
    "The Python language supports the creation and application of\n",
    "user-defined functions, which can simplify program development by\n",
    "promoting code reuse (in a similar manner as importing packages\n",
    "developed by others, but in this case you are the code provider and\n",
    "consumer). In Python, a function is actually an object, like everything\n",
    "else, and they can thus be created and passed dynamically like any other\n",
    "data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python function is defined by using the `def` keyword, followed by the\n",
    "function name. After the function name are a set of matching parentheses\n",
    "that enclose the arguments to the function, and a colon character\n",
    "follows the closing parenthesis, which signifies the start of the code\n",
    "block that provides the function implementation and is known as the\n",
    "function body. As a simple example, the following function takes no\n",
    "arguments and simply prints a standard message:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def hello():\n",
    "    print(\"Hello World!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is called in a Python program by simply using its name\n",
    "followed by the parentheses, `hello()`, which will print out `Hello\n",
    "World!` to the display.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Doc Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard practice is to employ a docstring comment immediately after\n",
    "the function definiton line to provide documentation for the function.\n",
    "The Python interpreter will by default use this docstring as the\n",
    "official function documentation, which typically is accessed by using\n",
    "the built-in `help()` function. This is demonstrated in the following\n",
    "two code blocks, where we define and call this function, and\n",
    "subsequently access the documentation.\n",

    "### Function Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "A function can accept zero or more arguments by simply listing the\n",
    "argument names between the parentheses. These argument names are the\n",
    "names you use to access the values contained in these arguments within\n",
    "the function body. for example, we can modify the original `hello`\n",
    "function to take a `name` argument that is used when printing out a\n",
    "welcome message:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def hello(name):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Display a welcome message to the user.\"\"\"\n",
    "    print(\"Hello {0}\".format(name))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When called with an argument `Alexander`, this function will print\n",
    "`Hello Alexander`. Functions can take multiple arguments, they are\n",
    "simply separated by commas, and they can take data structures as\n",
    "arguments, like lists or tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def hellolist(names, text):\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Display a welcome message to the user(s) listed in the names, \n",
    "    which is assumed to be a list. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    for name in names:\n",
    "        print(\"Hello {0}, {1}\".format(name, text))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If this function is called as \n",
    "`hellolist(['Alex', 'Joe', 'Jane'], \"welcome to class.\")`, \n",
    "the following output is displayed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hello Alex, welcome to class.\n",
    "Hello Joe, welcome to class.\n",
    "Hello Jane, welcome to class.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, a function accepts one or more arguments that often have\n",
    "_defualt_ values. Python supports default arguments that enable a Python\n",
    "programmer to specify a default value for an argument, which can be\n",
    "overridden if the user supplies a specific value. A default argument is\n",
    "specified by simply including an equal sign and the default value after\n",
    "a specific argument, like `text = ' welcome to class.'`. With this\n",
    "default argument for the `hellolist` function, we could leave off the\n",
    "second argument if desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "Default arguments are often used in functions that are part of large\n",
    "packages, like `numpy` or `matplotlib` to simplify their use. New users\n",
    "can quickly call he functions, while advanced users can achieve more\n",
    "control of the function by specifying additional arguments explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keyword Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "One last aspect of function arguments is that when a function is called,\n",
    "the argument names listed in the function definition can be explicitly\n",
    "specified, along with the values they should take when the function is\n",
    "called. This type of function call is said to be using _keyword\n",
    "arguments_. When using keyword arguments, the order of the arguments\n",
    "listed in the function call is arbitrary and does not need to explicitly\n",
    "match the argument order listed in the function definition. For example,\n",
    "we could call the hellolist function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "hellolist(text=' welcome to class', names = ['Alex', 'Joe', 'Jane'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Returning Values\n",
    "\n",
    "A function can return values by using the `return` keyword. Single\n",
    "values are returned as the type of the value, while multiple values are\n",
    "returned as a tuple of values. These two cases are demonstrated in the\n",
    "following sample code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def hello2():\n",
    "   return \"Hello World!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "def hello3(name):\n",
    "    return \"Hello, \", name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling the first function in this sample code as `msg = hello2()` will\n",
    "assign the string `Hello World!` to the `msg` variable, while calling\n",
    "the second of these functions as `msg = hello3()` will assign the tuple\n",
    "`('Hello', name)` to the `msg` variable. Note that for the `hello3`\n",
    "function, the argument is not required, as written, to be a string;\n",
    "therefore, the return tuple will have a string as the first element and\n",
    "the second element will be the same type as the argument `name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, when returning multiple values as a tuple, we can either enclose\n",
    "the values in parentheses, or simply separate them with commas as shown\n",
    "in the example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lambda Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also supports the ability to create unnamed functions, which are\n",
    "short functions that are defined and used in place. An unnamed function\n",
    "in Python is called a `lambda` function, and is defined by using the\n",
    "`lambda` keyword. lambda functions are often used in comprehensions or\n",
    "in function calls, when an argument expects a function. For example, we\n",
    "can create a `lambda` function that takes multiple arguments and assign\n",
    "to an arbitrary variable for later invocation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "f = lambda x, y: x**2 + y**3\n",
    "\n",
    "print(f(3, 4))\n",
    "\n",
    "73\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a lambda function to create a list comprehension, either\n",
    "implicitly with defined function like the previous example, or explicitly\n",
    "with an in-place `lambda` function. In either case, we can use the `map`\n",
    "function to apply the function to a range of input arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[x for x in map(lambda x: (3*x**2 + 2*x + 4), range(-3,4))]\n",
    "```\n",
    "Will create the following list: \n",
    "\n",
    "    [25, 12, 5, 4, 9, 20, 37]\n",
