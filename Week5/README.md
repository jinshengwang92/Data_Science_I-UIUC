## Networking and File Input/Output ##

The lessons this week will focus on learning how to use: networking commands inside of Unix, such as ping, netstat, etc.; archiving/compression commands in Unix; and commands used to find files using given criteria.  Next, we will go on to learn about writing and executing a complete program, how to open and close files, and file input/output all in Python.  Finally, we will touch on the Requests library inside of Python, as well as go over what network programming in Python requires.
